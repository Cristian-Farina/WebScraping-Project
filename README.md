# WebScraping-Project
A Python project to scrape website data and analyze it.

🛒 Product Price Scraper
📘 Description

This project is a simple web scraper built in Python to collect product prices from websites.
The main goal is to practice Python, data extraction, and automation — as part of my learning path toward AI and data-related work.
Future versions may include automated updates, data visualization, or integration with machine learning models.

⚙️ Installation
Requirements

Python 3.10+

Recommended editor: VS Code

Libraries

You’ll install them later as you go, but typically you’ll use:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml pandas


When you learn more, you can add them to a requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage

Run the script from VS Code or terminal:

python main.py


Example output (to be added later):

Scraping product data...
✅ Saved prices.csv with 50 products.

🧩 Steps / Workflow

You’ll update this section as you add features. Example structure:

Create a Python file and fetch a webpage (using requests)

Parse HTML to extract product info (BeautifulSoup)

Store results in a .csv file (pandas)

Clean up and format data

Later: schedule updates or send alerts for price changes

🚀 Future Work

Add support for multiple websites

Visualize price trends

Send notifications when price drops

Learn about APIs instead of scraping HTML

Explore AI integration for smarter automation

📚 Learning Focus

This project helps me strengthen:

Python fundamentals (loops, functions, data handling)

Web scraping (requests, BeautifulSoup)

Git & GitHub workflow

Project documentation and reproducibility
